<h3>🎯 Project Description!</h3>
</div>

In this project, I will leverage the power of Deep Learning to detect and classify various plant diseases. Specifically, we'll be focusing on diseases in tomato plants.

With climate change and the increasing demand for food production, it's essential to enhance our agricultural practices. Detecting plant diseases early can lead to timely treatment, preventing losses and ensuring better yields. However, manual disease detection can be time-consuming and requires expertise.

Enter Deep Learning! By training a model on images of plant leaves, we can automate the disease detection process, making it more efficient and accessible.

Our dataset contains images of tomato leaves and stucture of my folder is:

<h3> I will go through the following steps:</h3>
</div>


* 🔍 Data Exploration - visualize our data and check the distribution of different classes.
* 🧹 Data Preprocessing - load and preprocess our image data to make it suitable for a neural network.
* 🛠 Model Building - build a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras.
* 🎯 Model Training - train our model on our dataset, using a separate validation set to monitor its performance.
* 📊 Model Evaluation - evaluate our model's performance on a separate test set.
* 🔄 Model Improvement - try different strategies to improve our model's performance.
* 🖼️ Result Visualization - visualize our results to make them interpretable.
